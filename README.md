# python-challenge-1
## By Sami Chowdhury

The second module challenge for the Columbia AI Bootcamp. I found the challenge reasonable as the code could be reused from what was given to help solve the rest of the required code. The assignment did not take me very long because of that. 

To run, please run the following command in terminal/command line once cloned into the repo:

``> python menu.py ``
